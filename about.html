  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project assists visually impaired individuals by using computer vision and AI to detect and identify objects in real time.
    A camera-equipped device captures surroundings, processes them, and provides audio narration.
    The system enhances independence, accessibility, and safety — helping users navigate environments confidently.
